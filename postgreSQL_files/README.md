These tables have been created in a local PostgreSQL database called 'checkyourcar'.

![tables_screenshot](https://github.com/esrdarev/jefek/blob/main/postgreSQL_files/tables_screenshot.png)

Use the code in the table setup file to establish the database locally.

Tasks for future sprints:

- Migrate databases to Google Cloud
- Secure the information in the databases using PostgreSQL inbuilt functionality, e.g. encryption
- Add safety issue data from client
