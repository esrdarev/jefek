These tables have been created in a local PostgreSQL database called 'checkyourcar' (see screenshot).

Tasks for future sprints:

- Migrate databases to Google Cloud
- Secure the information in the databases using PostgreSQL inbuilt functionality, e.g. encryption
- Add safety issue data from client
