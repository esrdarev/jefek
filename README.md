SIT223 Group Project

This github site provides a site for the project team to collaborate on the web application for CheckYourCar. It holds the work we have completed in the first two sprints of our project. 

All the files here are local instances (at this stage). The front-end website framework has been established and is held in the bootstrap files section. Similarly, a lean back end that uses security libraries has been created and is stored here in the back end files section. The back end is fully interactive with the PostgreSQL database, which has been set up with a small amount of dummy data.
